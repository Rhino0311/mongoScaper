# mongoScaper

What the project does? Its a mongoose scraper version of NYT news. It takes news articles from NYT and allows the user to add and delete notes. They are only exclusive to that user. So they are not permament. 

Why the project is useful? It is useful for people who enjoy scraping from news articles from those outlets and like to leave personal notes. 

How users can get started with the project? They can get started by typing URL and begin scraping and logging notes. 

Where users can get help with your project? They can get help for this project from the Coding Bootcamp at UT.

Who maintains and contributes to the project? I was the only one that contributed to this project. I will maintain this program until end of semester.
